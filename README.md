# Telegram

This api helps you send quick messages to your telegram contacts

To utilize this Telegram RayClient, users are required to input their API ID and API hash in the preferences pane

Upon executing the 'Quick Message' command for the first time, the application will prompt you to enter your phone number. Subsequently, an authentication code will be sent to your telegram app

This authentication process generates a session key, which is then reused for all subsequent authentications and message transmissions to your contacts.
